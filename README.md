# sustain 4 SWT
This repository contains all the data and documents used to write the article "[A framework for technico-environmental optimization of small wind turbines](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124502)" 

It also contains the codes used to create a tool to help the small wind turbine installation decision making. 

- **interface** contains a trace_animation_bokeh.html file generated from the python code trace_animation_bokeh.py using bokeh library  
- **map** contains a jupyter notebook to generate the optimal height tiff image and a html file to display tiff images on an interactive map using leaflet library
- **LCA** contains all tha data for the wind turbine life cycle assessment

To test the interface and see the map, go to the Github page [here](https://vlechappe.github.io/sustain-4-SWT/)

Please feel free to contact us for more information.
